简爱第一天：

   中文版一段：

         此时此刻，刚才提到的伊丽莎、约翰和乔治亚娜都在客厅里，簇拥着他们的妈妈。她则斜倚在炉边的沙发上，身旁坐着自己的小宝贝们（眼下既未争吵也未哭叫），一副安享天伦之乐的神态。而我呢，她恩准我不必同他们坐在一起了，说是她很遗憾，不得不让我独个儿在一旁呆着。要是没有亲耳从贝茜那儿听到，并且亲眼看到，我确实在尽力养成一种比较单纯随和的习性，活泼可爱的举止，也就是更开朗、更率直、更自然些，那她当真不让我享受那些只配给予快乐知足的孩子们的特权了.

     英文版原著

          The said Eliza,John,and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room:she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside,and with her darlings about her(for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.Me,she had dispensed from joining the group;saying,She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance;but that until she(这个主语不知道指谁) heard from Bessid,and could discover by her  own observation,that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition,a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter,franker,more natural ,as it were --she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented,happy,little children。

我自己翻译一次（现在程度相当于是抄原著的翻译）
